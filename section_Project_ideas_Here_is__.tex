\section{Project ideas}
Here is a (non-exhaustive) list of projects where we see need for collaboration between experiments and theory.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\pi\pi$ S-wave parameterisation
\item Dispersion relation analysis, Khuri-Treimann amplitudes
\item Constrained fits. Many of the parameterisations suggested by theorists contain non-trivial relations between parameters in the model. We need the technology to add constraints to the data. An example is the couple-channel parameterisation of the X(3872) line shape https://arxiv.org/abs/0704.0605\cite{Hanhart_2007}. Constraints can be implemented using Lagrange multipliers. This would be a new feature in amplitude analyses.
\end{itemize}
