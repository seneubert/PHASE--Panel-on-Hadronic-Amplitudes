\section{Vision and Goals}

The vision of PHASE is to enable joint analysis of hadronic processes across multiple experiments and multiple data sets. It provides a forum and infrastructure for joint developments within the hadron physics community and defines best practices.

To make progress in the understanding of strong interaction phenomena, it is necessary to combine the information gathered by several experiments across a wide range of energies in a coherent fashion. Due to the complexity of hadron dynamics, this is a non-trivial problem. Current state-of-the-art techniques for extracting hadronic amplitudes from data exhibit model dependencies, which need to be quantified. Only then will it be become possible to use high precision measurements, obtained in a dedicated experiment, as constraints for analyses of other data sets. 

Progress can be made, if first methods are developed to extract universal features from the data. Second, procedures for data handling across experiments are needed, which allow the transfer of those universal features. Theorists have developed the basic ideas on how such universal features can be defined. However, considerable technical challenges have so far prohibited the full implementation of theses ideas into the data analysis frameworks of the current generation of experiments. The outstanding challenges and possible angles of attack have been discussed and documented in a series of workshops during the past few years \cite{Battaglieri_2015, Brice_o_2016, Lutz_2016}. It is now a consensus in the community that to overcome said challenges, a closer exchange between phenomenologists and experimentalists is needed.

The first and foremost goal of the PHASE network is to facilitate this exchange. 

The activities carried out in the project aim at providing researchers with useful tools for data analysis. They will produce actual software implementations of amplitude models. The focus will be on advanced models that cannot be produced by a single collaboration but need combined expertise from several actors. PHASE puts the software implementation of the physics models into the center of it's activities. It's goal is to advance complex analysis projects from the conceptual to the actual.
