\subsection{PHASE Repository}

\subsection{Hadron Amplitude Hackathons}
PHASE will organize regular workshops, which will take the form of Hackathons where experts work on a concrete problem, such as providing a certain parameterization to the analysts. Each hackathon will have a concrete goal and will deliver actual software, which is provided to the experiments through the PHASE repository.

In order to test and develop these tools the experimental collaborations will be asked to provide simulated data, or where applicable, measured data sets. 

\subsection{Annual review on amplitude analysis}

\subsection{Amplitude model validation}

\subsection{Community building}
