We propose to form a joint panel, composed of delegates from experimental collaborations and members of the theory community, who are engaged in the investigation of the structure of hadronic amplitudes. Seeking a deeper understanding of strong interaction dynamics the panel will work towards a closer integration of experiment and theory with the goal to improve data analysis techniques and enable joint analysis across multiple data sets. PHASE aims to become the central hub for amplitude analysis expertise in Europe and will publish an annual review on the state of the art of the field.
This letter of intent is an invitation for all researchers in hadron physics. It lays out the structure and activities of PHASE and is intended to bring together the efforts across the community to form a common forum and start taking joint action.
