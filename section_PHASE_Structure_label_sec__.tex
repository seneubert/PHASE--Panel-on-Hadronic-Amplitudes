\section{PHASE Structure}
\label{sec:structure}
PHASE consists of two representatives (liaisons) from each experiment and a number of representatives (liaisons) from the theory community. Experimental plus theory liaisons make up the PHASE panel as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:structure}. The panel elects a speaker to represent PHASE to the public and to funding agencies. It holds regular virtual meetings to coordinate the activities outlined in section \ref{sec:activities}. Panel members assume the following responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item ensure the flow of information between the partaking institutions
\item curate the PHASE repository
\item ensure the publication of an annual review article on the state of art of amplitude analyses
\item draft joint funding applications for the PHASE project
\item decide on allocation of jointly acquired funding
\end{itemize}

The panel is supported by a core team of volunteers.
