\section{PHASE Structure}
\label{sec:structure}
PHASE consists of two representatives (liaisons) from each experiment and a number of representatives (liaisons) from the theory community. Experimental plus theory liaisons make up the PHASE panel as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:structure}. The panel elects a speaker to represent PHASE to the public and to funding agencies. It holds regular virtual meetings to coordinate the activities outlined in section \ref{sec:activities}. 

The panel is supported by a core team of volunteers.
