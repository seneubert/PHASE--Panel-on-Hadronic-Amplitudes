\section{PHASE Structure}
\label{sec:structure}
PHASE consists of two representatives (liaisons) from each experiment and a number of representatives (liaisons) from the theory community. The liaisons make up the actual panel. They elect a speaker to represent PHASE to the public and funding agencies. The panel holds regular virtual meetings to coordinate the activities outlined in section \ref{sec:activities}. The primary responsibility of the panel is, to ensure the flow of information between the partaking institutions.

In addition to the PHASE panel we foresee a core team.

\subsection{Theory Liaisons}

\subsection{Core Team}

\subsection{Founding institutions}
Experimental Collaborations: Belle II, BES III, COMPASS, LHCb 
Theory groups: Bonn, J\"ulich, Siegen, Valencia

The initiative is open to any interested experiment and theory group.
