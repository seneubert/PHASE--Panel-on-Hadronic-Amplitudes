\section{Publication policy}
\label{sec:publications}
PHASE will ensure that the models submitted to the repository (see section \ref{sec:repo}) are attributed to the original authors. Existing publications will be used as citations wherever they are available. In cases when a model is created collaboratively on the repository, alternative methods of attribution, such as \href{http://openbadges.org}{software badges} will be provided. When a collaborative model reaches a state of sophistication that allows it to be used in an analysis, PHASE will assist in the publication of a paper with an author list containing all contributors to the code, which can then be referenced by the data analysis publication.

Since PHASE will curate software implementations of the models and not just the documentation and since both the software code and its technical as well as physics documentation will have to be closely tied together, PHASE publications will target open access publication formats, which allow such integrated documents to be presented adequately.
