\section{Publication policy}
\label{sec:publications}
PHASE will ensure that the models submitted to the repository (see section \ref{sec:repo}) are attributed to the original authors. Existing publications will be used as citations wherever they are available. In cases when a model is created collaboratively on the repository, alternative methods of attribution, such as \href{http://openbadges.org}{software badges} will be provided. When a collaborative model reaches a state of sophistication that allows it to be used in an analysis, PHASE will assist in the publication of a paper with an author list containing all contributors to the code, which can then be referenced by the data analysis publication.
