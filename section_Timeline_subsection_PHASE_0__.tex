\subsection{PHASE 0}
In the preparatory phase the project is being set up by a core-team of volunteers from the founding institutions. The goal of this phase is to get buy-in from all relevant
experimental collaborations\footnote{COMPASS, BES III, Belle, Belle II, LHCb, CLEO, BaBar, CLAS, GlueX, CrystalBarrel, SND, CMD-2, PANDA} and the theoretical community.  The core team has prepared this document to propose the PHASE structure and activity portfolio and invites contributions from the joining institutions.

In accordance with the member institutions a host for the PHASE repository is found. The repository server with communication infrastructure is established.


Phase 0 has started with the drafting of the PHASE proposal and will end with the formation of the first PHASE panel at the ATOS workshop in March 2017.

\subsection{PHASE 1}
The panel prepares a first series of hackathons and starts to acquire funding.

Phase 1 ends with the employment of the first batch of fellows in summer 2018.
\subsection{PHASE 2}
PHASE executes its fully funded program.
